I really appreciate the balance that she struck between staying on topic and making sure that questions get answered.

Hats off to Joy for her grace and focus. I found today's session incredibly helpful.

	•	She was very informative and knowledgeable in using charts.

	•	i love how prepared and knowledgeable you are

	•	Great job Joy. Thank you.

	•	I really liked the personal touch in this class - opinions and facts separated, but discussed
	•	Very good examples, good team involvement, well in hand of the presenter

	•	I think overall, this was a really good course. I already knew a lot of it but I can see that if you didn't already know the concepts, this was really great. Instructor today was really focused and did not worry too much about what was going on in the Chat, on previous days she seemed too scattered and kept jumping back to it (which in a class with 700 learners, was a lot). She was great to keep reminding the group of the intention of the class and not to stray outside of the scope of the 'syllabus'. Today had lots of great examples and useful exercises. Plus lots and lots of resources to look at outside of class.

	•	100% respect the redirection to stay on topic and within the scope of this course.

	•	Joy Hopkins is such a great trainer. I enjoyed her style of giving the information

	•	fantastic sessions! Joy was receptive and has provided a wealth of relevant references. Eian was supportive as well above and beyond!

	•	She's fantastic!

	•	This bootcamp was amazing! Despite the time difference I was looking forward to each session. Joy Hopkins has done an amazing job with providing the information in comprehensive way and I love that she was always answering all the questions in the chat and Q&A

	•	I really want to compliment Joy on the RADICAL pivot from Day 1 to today's class. I know that it is not easy to receive strong feedback about your performance, but today was a PHENOMENAL improvement. Joy was able to stay focused and moved through the material with clarity and focus, while still responding to questions in an organized manner. I would absolutely recommend this course and her as an instructor after today. For reference, I gave a 1 on the scale yesterday regarding whether I would recommend this course to others. I also found the section on reducing chart clutter and best practices fantastic. I am looking forward to days 3 and 4.

Co-worker Shout-Out 9/18
Joylyn Hopkins has been able to take student feedback from day one of class and incorporate solutions and address that feedback in the very next class. Not only is she taking criticism and changing it into action, but also able to do that on a very short time table. This is super tough and she should totally get a shout out! -Red
